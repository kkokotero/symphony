# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sexual characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive community environment include:

* Showing empathy and kindness to others
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and accepting constructive feedback graciously
* Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not only for us as individuals, but for the community as a whole

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and any unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing private information about others, such as physical or email addresses, without explicit permission
* Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing acceptable behavior standards and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate the reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, as well as when an individual represents the community officially in public spaces.
Examples of community representation include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
