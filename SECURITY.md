# **Security Policy**

## 1. Introduction

This policy defines the guidelines for the **reception**, **assessment**, **management**, and **responsible disclosure** of security vulnerabilities in products and services developed by **Synphony**.
Its purpose is to ensure clear communication with researchers, users, and stakeholders, while maintaining the security and integrity of the software.

---

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:

* All software developed and officially maintained by **Synphony**.
* Services, APIs, libraries, and related components.
* Technical documentation and associated tools.

It does **not** apply to third-party software not managed by our team, although we may recommend measures to mitigate risks.

---

## 3. Vulnerability Reporting

**Reporting Channels:**

* **GitHub (public)**: Open an *issue* in the official repository [Synphony Issues](https://github.com/kkokotero/synphony/issues) for non-sensitive issues.

**Response Times:**

| Action                         | Maximum Time                   |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| Acknowledgment                 | 48 hours                       |
| First status update            | 5 business days                |
| Solution or plan communication | Variable depending on severity |

---

## 4. Vulnerability Management Process

Our workflow follows **ISO/IEC 30111** guidelines:

1. **Reception** of the report and confirmation to the researcher.
2. **Technical validation** of the finding and severity assignment (according to CVSS v3.1).
3. **Impact analysis** and affected versions.
4. **Development of the fix** (hotfix or planned update).
5. **Regression and QA testing** to prevent side effects.
6. **Patch publication** and technical documentation.
7. **Coordinated disclosure** with the researcher (if applicable).

---

## 5. Responsible Disclosure Policy

* Do not publicly disclose technical details before the patch is available.
* The researcher may request **joint disclosure** once the update is released.
* We will acknowledge contributions in the release notes, unless the researcher requests anonymity.
* Critical vulnerabilities will receive a **CVE** (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) issued in coordination with MITRE.

---

## 6. Recommended Best Practices

To reduce security risks, we recommend:

* Always maintain the latest stable version of **Synphony**.
* Enable end-to-end encryption in communications (HTTPS/TLS).
* Enable **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** on critical accounts.
* Apply the principle of **least privilege** for permissions.
* Review and audit dependencies with tools like `npm audit` or `OWASP Dependency-Check`.
* Perform periodic encrypted backups.
* Configure intrusion detection systems (IDS/IPS).

---

## 7. Security Contact

For any communications regarding vulnerabilities:

* **GitHub**: [https://github.com/kkokotero/synphony/issues](https://github.com/kkokotero/synphony/issues)
* **Updated security policy**: [Security.md](https://github.com/kkokotero/synphony/blob/main/SECURITY.md)

## 8. Appendix — Severity (CVSS v3.1)

| Score    | Severity |
| -------- | -------- |
| 0.1–3.9  | Low      |
| 4.0–6.9  | Medium   |
| 7.0–8.9  | High     |
| 9.0–10.0 | Critical |

Here is an **official vulnerability report template** in **Markdown**, aligned with the security policy for researchers to copy and submit:
