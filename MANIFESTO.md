# Manifesto

Symphony doesn’t just build servers.
It creates harmony between them.

HTTP and WebSocket are not separate worlds,
but distinct channels of the same symphony.
Every request, every message,
flows under the same rhythm.

Symphony was born from a simple idea:
building a server shouldn’t be complex.
It should be lightweight, expressive, and easy to extend—
a server that breathes with the developer,
not one that suffocates them with configurations or needless abstractions.

You don’t need a grand architecture to begin,
just a solid foundation and a natural flow.
Each module knows when to play,
each plugin can extend the core’s capabilities
without breaking its simplicity.

The developer doesn’t adapt to Symphony; they conduct it.
Symphony offers a high-level API,
yet never hides access to its native core.
You have total control—
from the routes to the lowest socket.

It doesn’t aim to abstract complexity,
but to organize it.
It doesn’t lock you into its structure;
it invites you to build your own.
Every component is optional,
every layer replaceable or extendable.
Minimalism without limits.
Efficiency without friction.
Freedom without compromise.

The server isn’t destroyed with every request—
it lives in sync with its clients.
HTTP and WS work together,
without hacks or artificial branches.
Routers, middlewares, and plugins
aren’t imposed layers,
they’re musicians performing the same piece.

Symphony doesn’t seek to control your application,
but to accompany it.
To give it rhythm, coherence, and modularity—
so you can compose your own symphony.

Because a server shouldn’t be a black box,
but a tool that resonates with you.
Modularity doesn’t divide—it liberates.

Symphony doesn’t compete with complexity;
it transforms it into clarity.
It doesn’t strive to do more,
but to do it better.

Performance is not its ultimate goal—
it’s the natural outcome of a well-orchestrated design.
And the developer experience,
its main melody.

Where every request is a note,
every module an instrument,
and every server, a symphony.
